Title:       Cross-Validation for the SVD (Bi-Cross-Validation)
Author:      Patrick O. Perry, Wei Fu
Maintainer:  Patrick O. Perry <pperry@stern.nyu.edu>
Description: 
    Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD approximation via cross
    validation.  The package provides both Gabriel-style "block"
    holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  It also includes an 
    implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.  For more information about
    Bi-cross-validation, see Owen & Perry's 2009 AoAS article
    (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2062) and Perry's 2009 PhD thesis
    (at http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3052).
